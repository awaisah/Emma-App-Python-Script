# Emma App Python Script

This repository contains a python script (script.py) which outputs 2 new files (contacts.json and requires.txt). 

## Instructions To Run The Script

### Step 1 - Clone The Repository
```git clone https://github.com/awaisah/Emma-App-Python-Script.git```
### Step 2 - Enter Project Folder
```cd Emma-App-Python-Script```
### Step 3 - Run Script
```python script.py```

Once the has been run the following should be outputted in the console:]
```SUCCESS: Exported contacts.json with contacts details. Exported requires.txt with code to enter into the index.js file in the React Native project (assets/avatars/index.js file)```

The required files are generated and the file names for the avatars have been updated.

#### NOTE: The reason for changing the file names of the avatar images is because React Native struggled to display the images when the filename had a space in it.
